- 👋 Hi, I’m Jie Xu, a final-year Ph.D. candidate at City University of Hong Kong.
- 👀 I’m interested in ensuring security and reliability in technology, particularly in fields like cybersecurity, blockchain consensus, and trustworthy AI.
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring the large model learning and unlearning, and how these concepts can revolutionize data processing and system security.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative projects that seek to enhance the security, efficiency, and reliability of decentralized systems and AI technologies.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me at jiexu49-c@my.cityu.edu.hk for research collaborations, academic discussions, or just a friendly chat about the latest in tech.
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not engaged in my research, I love diving into the realms of science fiction novels. They fuel my imagination and offer a refreshing break from my intense academic pursuits. Also, I have a keen interest in wellness and healthy living, which helps me maintain balance in life.
